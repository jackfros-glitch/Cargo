# Cargo 
Cargo is a Django-based backend system for an AI-powered content recommendation platform. That handles user subscriptions and recommend content based on users behavior.

## Getting Started 

### Clone the repository:

To get started you have to first clone the repository to your local machine

You can do that using ssh 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jackfros-glitch/Cargo.git
```
or https
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackfros-glitch/Cargo.git
```




### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.x

    Django 3.x or later

    Django REST Framework

    DRF-YASG (for Swagger documentation)

    Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)



### Installing Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7**

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python).

2. **Virtual Environment**

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. The instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

Instruction to create a virtual environment under the root project directory
(\jk-holdings-backend):
macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Windows:
```bash
py -3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
macOS/Linux:
```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

If you want to switch projects or otherwise leave your virtual environment, simply run:
```bash
deactivate
```
3. **PIP Dependencies**

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

## Set up the Database

- Run migrations to set up the database:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

- Create a superuser (for accessing the Django admin interface):

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Running the server

From within the root directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Access the API Documentation: 
- Once the server is running, you can view the API documentation generated by Swagger at:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/)
